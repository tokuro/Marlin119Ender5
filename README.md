# Marlin119Ender5
My setup of Ender 5 with BTTouch based on Marlin 1.1.9 bug fix branch

Marlin 1.1.9 Bug fix, snapped on 4/47/2020
enabled BLTouch (7x7 mesh)
moved printer origin to be front left side (from back corner)
made nice homing so that it won't slam the frame

disabled other minor things to make it all fit.
